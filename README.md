# Virus and bacterial pathogen in the MR-SNWDC

Bacterial pathogens and viruses have been the leading causes of global waterborne diseases. Therefore, enormous efforts have been made to reduce health or ecological risk from them using various treatment technologies and management strategies. However, the new challenge is that are there any alternative strategies by use of natural forces to improve water quality economically? In the present work, we provided a novel strategy of “self-purification” from the perspective of virus-pathogen interactions under extreme phosphorous constrains in the world’s longest water diversion canal. Our study revealed the repressed environmental fitness of bacterial pathogens, the amplified viral predation effects, and the corresponded pathogen recessions under low phosphorous, which highlighted the potential significance of water self-purification associated with virus-pathogen interactions in reducing health risks from waterborne pathogens.
